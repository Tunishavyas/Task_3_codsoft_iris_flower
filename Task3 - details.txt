TASK 3 : IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION 

Problem statement:
The Iris flower dataset consists of three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. These species can be distinguished based on their
measurements. Now, imagine that you have the measurements of Iris flowers categorized by their respective species.

1.Your objective is to train a machine learning model that can learn from these measurements and accurately classify the Iris flowers into
their respective species.
2.Use the Iris dataset to develop a model that can classify iris flowers into different species based on their sepal and petal
measurements. This dataset is widely used for introductory classification tasks. 

This dataset became a typical test case for many statistical classification techniques in machine learning such as support vector machines, KNN Classifiers , etc.
The dataset contains a set of 150 records under 5 attributes - Petal Length, Petal Width, Sepal Length, Sepal width and Class(Species).

Work Flow:
Data Pre-processing step
Fitting the K-NN algorithm to the Training set
Predicting the test result
Test accuracy of the result(Creation of Confusion matrix)
Visualizing the test set result.

Conclusion :
The KNN(K- Nearest Neighbors) algorithm is simple yet effective classification method.It predicts the class label of new data point with full accuracy. This model is effective for given Iris flower dataset
